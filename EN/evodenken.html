          Evolutionary thinking is based on the idea that our bodies developed in a specific environment. Modern life differs greatly from that environment, which can contribute to many health issues. By understanding where we come from, we can make choices that better match how our bodies naturally function. Below are six core principles we often explore during consultations.
        </p>

        <p data-ani><strong>1. Nutrition</strong></p>
        <p data-ani>
          In the past, people had to gather or hunt their own food. Today, food is available everywhere, which means we often consume processed products high in fat, sugar and salt. A dietary pattern more similar to that of our ancestors — natural foods such as lean meat, fish, vegetables, fruits and nuts — generally supports health better.
          According to scientific guidelines, it is recommended to limit red meat to a maximum of 500 grams per week.
        </p>

        <p data-ani><strong>2. Movement</strong></p>
        <p data-ani>
          Our bodies are built to move: walking, running, lifting and carrying. Long periods of sitting are a modern phenomenon and place strain on the body. Movement should therefore be a consistent part of a healthy lifestyle. Choose forms of activity that fit your daily routine and feel functional.
        </p>

        <p data-ani><strong>3. Sleep</strong></p>
        <p data-ani>
          Healthy sleep aligns with our natural day–night rhythm, also known as the circadian rhythm. Daylight helps us stay alert, while reducing bright artificial light in the evening allows the body to prepare for rest.
        </p>

        <p data-ani><strong>4. Stress</strong></p>
        <p data-ani>
          Our stress response originally evolved to react quickly to danger. Today we mainly experience long-term, psychological stress — something the body is less suited for. Techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, physical activity or social support can help reduce this ongoing tension.
        </p>

        <p data-ani><strong>5. Social connection</strong></p>
        <p data-ani>
          Humans are social beings. Strong relationships contribute to both physical and mental health. Maintaining social contact is therefore an important part of a healthy lifestyle.
        </p>

        <p data-ani><strong>6. Environment</strong></p>
        <p data-ani>
          Contact with nature helps reduce stress and supports well-being. Although most people live in urban settings, spending time outdoors in green environments remains valuable.
        </p>

        <p data-ani>
          Evolutionary thinking does not mean we should live like prehistoric humans. It means understanding what our bodies need and how we can take that into account in modern life.
        </p>

        <p data-ani><strong>In summary</strong></p>
        <p data-ani>
          Through natural selection, humans have adapted for millions of years to changing environments. These adaptations shaped our bodies, behaviour and psyche. Our ability to walk upright, form social structures and think the way we do arises from this evolutionary history. Recognising this biological foundation helps explain why we make certain choices.
        </p>

        <p data-ani>
          Still, evolution is only one part of the story. Culture, upbringing and personal experience also play meaningful roles. Evolutionary thinking simply offers a useful framework to better understand health and lifestyle.
