          Over recent years our eating habits have become increasingly dependent on external sources
          outside our own kitchen. We have gradually become used to supermarkets and restaurants providing
          and preparing our food. This shift is partly driven by the convenience we seek ourselves.
          From an evolutionary point of view, our brain wants to conserve energy and prefers efforts
          with low intensity and a high nutritional payoff. This mechanism made sense for survival in
          earlier conditions, such as those of hunter-gatherers.

          The food industry makes use of this natural mechanism. Products rich in fat, sugar and salt
          activate our reward system. The quick availability and strong appeal of foods high in fat,
          sugar and salt tap into the natural tendencies of our brain, leading to overconsumption and
          health problems.

          The key lies in awareness. By understanding how companies respond to our preferences, we can
          make more conscious choices.
