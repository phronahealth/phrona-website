        Nutrition is a core element of how we understand health. In previous articles, we explored how our eating patterns are shaped by different internal and external factors. Here, we focus on the question: what does the body actually need? To answer this, we look at the science and break down the fundamentals of nutrition.
      </p>

      <p data-ani>
        There will never be a single universal guideline for what every individual needs. Genetics, physiological requirements, cultural influences and personal preferences all contribute to our nutritional needs. To gain clarity, we look at the three major components the body uses for maintenance: carbohydrates, proteins and fats. These are known as macronutrients — the “large” nutrients.

        Calories reflect the energy content of food and are essential for maintaining the body’s energy balance. The body acts as a complex energy generator: everything we do—thinking, walking, digestion—requires energy. Food is needed to keep this energy system in balance.
      </p>

      <p data-ani>
        Food can be regarded as pure energy, provided in different forms. The unit used in nutrition science is the kilocalorie (kcal), where 1 kcal equals 1000 calories. The energy per gram differs between macronutrients.
      </p>

      <p data-ani>
        Carbohydrates, proteins and fats each support vital functions. Carbohydrates are the body’s primary energy source. Proteins form the building blocks of tissues such as muscles and organs. Fats are essential components of our cells. Each of these nutrients contains a specific amount of energy. Alcohol also contributes to energy intake, providing 7 kcal per gram.
        <br><br>
        Besides macronutrients, there are micronutrients — vitamins and minerals — needed in smaller amounts. They do not provide energy themselves, but they support the metabolic processes that release energy from food. Table 2 lists key vitamins and minerals, their functions and their food sources.
