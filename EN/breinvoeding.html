          The primary function of food is to provide the body with essential nutrients. Once we eat, these nutrients are broken down and used to maintain our bodily functions. The human brain has evolved to manage energy efficiently. When different food options are available, the brain naturally prefers the option with the highest nutritional value.

          This becomes clear in moments of hunger. When the stomach signals that it is empty, the hormone ghrelin rises and we feel the urge to eat. If we choose food outside the home, that decision is influenced by a complex mix of factors: previous experiences, personal preferences, convenience, distance, hormonal balance and nutritional knowledge. A recurring question in this process is often: which option gives me the most benefit?

          The brain values macronutrients such as fats, sugars and salt, because these substances stimulate dopamine release. Dopamine plays an important role in habit formation and creates a pleasant sensation when released. Fast food — rich in fat, sugar and salt — can therefore exert strong attraction and unconsciously shape our eating habits.

          However, the choice does not always fall on fast food. Knowledge and awareness play a role too. For example, if we know we haven’t eaten fish in a while and understand the importance of omega-3 fatty acids for brain function, a choice such as a poke bowl may become more appealing. Even this ‘healthy choice’ is often based on unconscious evaluation shaped by previous experiences, learned information, hormonal signals, environment and genetic predisposition.

          Our brain is highly influenceable, but with sufficient knowledge and awareness, we can make healthier decisions. In practice, we tend to choose foods that are easily accessible and rich in taste and calories. This helps explain the immense pull and rapid growth of the fast-food industry, now a multibillion-dollar market.
