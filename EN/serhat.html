      <h2 data-ani>About me</h2>
      <p data-ani>
        I work as a dietitian in care institutions with a broad target group: from people who come in for
        rehabilitation to older adults moving into long-term care. I provide nutritional advice to optimise
        nutritional status and support recovery as effectively as possible. I also have extensive experience
        with people who can barely eat or no longer eat at all, where medical nutrition or tube feeding is
        required. In primary care I have guided many clients with overweight and obesity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my younger years I struggled with being overweight myself and was treated by several dietitians.
        Real change came when my mother signed me up for a gym. There I discovered my passion for fitness and
        powerlifting, which I practised for several years at amateur level. Nowadays I enjoy combat sports such
        as wrestling and kickboxing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I see it as a major pitfall that health is often approached in a very black-and-white way. Health is
        multifactorial: nutrition, movement, culture, home situation and mental load all play a role. I place
        a lot of value on the “why” question. Why does someone overeat? Why does someone barely eat at all?
        Once this becomes clear, a much more effective treatment plan can be created.
      </p>
      <p data-ani>
        Together with my brother I want to clarify the “grey area” around movement, nutrition and health.
        This led to the creation of Phrona, where we take the time to share our insights and knowledge on these
        concepts with our clients. On this page I give an impression of what my guidance looks like.
