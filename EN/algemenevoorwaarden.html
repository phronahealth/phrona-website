        <h2 data-ani><strong>2. Definitions and applicability</strong></h2>
        <p data-ani>
          In these terms and conditions, the following definitions apply:
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          – <strong>Phrona</strong>: the dietitian / practice providing dietetic care.<br>
          – <strong>Client</strong>: the individual making use of Phrona’s services.<br>
          – <strong>Agreement</strong>: the treatment agreement between Phrona and the client.<br>
          – <strong>Dietetic care</strong>: assessment, advice, treatment and guidance relating to nutrition and lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          These terms and conditions apply to all verbal and written agreements between Phrona
          and the client, unless explicitly agreed otherwise in writing.
        </p>

        <h2 data-ani><strong>3. Health insurers, reimbursement and personal payment</strong></h2>
        <p data-ani>
          For dietetics, Phrona has contracts with various health insurers, including Zilveren Kruis, VGZ,
          Menzis, DSW and a.s.r. The exact reimbursement depends on the client’s insurance policy. The client
          remains responsible for checking with their own insurer which care is reimbursed and under which conditions
          (for example, deductible requirements).
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          If dietetic care is not (fully) reimbursed by the insurer, or if the insurer does not pay out (retroactively),
          the remaining invoice amount will be charged directly to the client.
        </p>

        <h2 data-ani><strong>4. Rates and payment</strong></h2>
        <p data-ani>
          For non-reimbursed care or when the client pays out of pocket, Phrona charges the rates in effect at that time,
          as listed on the website or in the practice.
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          Payment must be made within 14 days of the invoice date, unless agreed otherwise in writing.
          Payment may be made via payment request, invoice or Tikkie.
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          If payment is not received, the client will generally first receive a payment reminder, followed by a second reminder.
          From the third reminder (formal notice), additional administrative or legal collection costs and statutory interest
          may be charged in accordance with the applicable laws.
        </p>

        <h2 data-ani><strong>5. Appointments, cancellation and no-show</strong></h2>
        <p data-ani>
          Appointments can be made via email, WhatsApp and – when available – by phone or through the online appointment form.
          The time reserved in the schedule is exclusively for the client.
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          An appointment can be cancelled or rescheduled free of charge up to 24 hours before the scheduled time.
          If cancelled or changed within 24 hours, or if the client does not attend the appointment (no-show), Phrona
          may charge 75% of the applicable fee for that appointment.
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          No-show fees are generally not reimbursed by health insurers and remain fully the client’s responsibility.
        </p>

        <h2 data-ani><strong>6. Client responsibility</strong></h2>
        <p data-ani>
          The client is responsible for providing accurate and complete information about their health, medication,
          medical history and any relevant circumstances that may affect the treatment.
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          The client is also responsible for promptly reporting changes in personal details, GP, health insurer, email address
          or other contact information.
        </p>

        <h2 data-ani><strong>7. Phrona’s responsibility</strong></h2>
        <p data-ani>
          Phrona provides dietetic care to the best of its knowledge and ability, following the professional standards
          and guidelines applicable to registered dietitians. The service provided is a best-effort obligation, not a
          guarantee of specific outcomes.
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          Phrona is bound by confidentiality and handles (medical) data with care. More information can be found in
          Phrona’s privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h2 data-ani><strong>8. Client file, data processing and practice software</strong></h2>
        <p data-ani>
          To deliver dietetic care, Phrona maintains an (electronic) client file containing relevant information
          regarding the client and the treatment, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This file is
          retained for the legally required period.
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          Phrona uses [insert name of EHR/practice software] to store client data and manage appointments. This system
          meets standard security and privacy requirements. A data processing agreement has been, or will be, concluded
          with the provider.
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          Information is shared with other healthcare providers (such as GP, specialist or physiotherapist) only
          after the client has provided explicit consent, unless required otherwise by law.
        </p>

        <h2 data-ani><strong>9. Communication, WhatsApp, Zorgmail and online consultations</strong></h2>
        <p data-ani>
          Phrona is reachable via email and WhatsApp for scheduling or modifying appointments and for short practical questions.
          Extensive or sensitive medical information will not be discussed via WhatsApp.
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          For communication of privacy-sensitive information between healthcare providers, a secure communication system,
          such as Zorgmail, is used.
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          When appropriate, Phrona also offers online consultations, for example via Microsoft Teams or another secure
          platform. The client is responsible for ensuring that their own equipment and internet connection offer
          sufficient privacy (for example, a private room without listeners).
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          The specific online platform used may change. Phrona will choose a solution that is appropriate and reasonable
          within current privacy and security requirements.
        </p>

        <h2 data-ani><strong>10. Complaints and disputes</strong></h2>
        <p data-ani>
          If the client is dissatisfied with the treatment or interaction, they are encouraged to first discuss the matter
          with the dietitian. In many cases, complaints can be resolved through mutual discussion.
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          If the complaint cannot be resolved through discussion, the client may use the formal complaints procedure and,
          if necessary, an independent dispute resolution body, in accordance with the Dutch Healthcare Quality, Complaints
          and Disputes Act (Wkkgz).
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          Phrona is (or will be) affiliated with: [insert name of complaints officer/complaints procedure] and
          [insert name of dispute resolution body]. The most up-to-date information will be listed on the website.
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          Submitting a complaint does not suspend the client’s payment obligation.
        </p>

        <h2 data-ani><strong>11. Liability</strong></h2>
        <p data-ani>
          Phrona is only liable for damage that is the direct result of an attributable shortcoming in the performance
          of dietetic care, provided that such shortcoming could reasonably have been prevented with due care.
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          Phrona’s liability is limited to the amount paid out in the relevant case under its professional liability
          insurance, plus any applicable deductible.
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          Phrona is not liable for indirect damages, consequential damages or loss of income.
        </p>

        <h2 data-ani><strong>12. Force majeure</strong></h2>
        <p data-ani>
          In cases of force majeure (including, but not limited to: illness of the dietitian, long-term system failures,
          pandemics, government measures or other circumstances in which care cannot reasonably be delivered), Phrona
          may temporarily suspend the agreement or reschedule appointments without being liable for damages.
        </p>

        <h2 data-ani><strong>13. Applicable law and jurisdiction</strong></h2>
        <p data-ani>
          Dutch law exclusively applies to the legal relationship between Phrona and the client.
          Disputes that cannot be resolved through the complaints procedure or dispute resolution body will be submitted
          to the competent court in the district where Phrona is located.
        </p>

        <h2 data-ani><strong>14. Final provisions</strong></h2>
        <p data-ani>
          If any provision of these terms and conditions proves to be void or is annulled, the remaining provisions
          remain fully effective. Phrona may amend these terms and conditions. The most recent version is always available
          on the Phrona website.
        </p>
        <p data-ani>
          This version of the terms and conditions enters into force on [insert effective date] and replaces all previous versions.
