      <h2 data-ani>About me</h2>
      <p data-ani>
        I work as a physiotherapist in primary care, helping people with a wide range of complaints:
        from long-term pain and chronic conditions to sports and shoulder complaints. My passion for
        the profession partly stems from my own experience with chronic issues. For years I did not feel
        heard and received conflicting advice. Working on your health is not as black-and-white as it
        sometimes seems. Through trial and error I developed a more effective way of working. By coincidence
        my brother is a dietitian, and we were able to use each other’s insights in this process.
      </p>
      <p data-ani>
        Together with my brother, I want to shed light on the “grey area” around movement, nutrition and health.
        This led to the creation of Phrona, where we take the time to share our insights and knowledge on these
        concepts with our clients. On this page I outline how my treatment process typically looks.
