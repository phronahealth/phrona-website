          At Phrona we understand that health is more than the absence of disease; it is
          a broad view of well-being that includes both body and mind. Our aim is not only
          to share knowledge, but also to give you the tools and insights you need to make
          healthy choices in the long term.
        </p>

        <p data-ani>
          Our name is derived from the concept of <em>phronesis</em>, which refers to the
          application of moral judgment and practical wisdom. At Phrona we provide nutritional
          advice and lifestyle guidance in a way that is grounded not only in scientific
          evidence, but also in ethical considerations and practical experience.
        </p>

        <p data-ani>
          We believe that decisions about health and well-being should not be based solely on
          facts and figures – important as they are – but also on a deep understanding of each
          person’s unique needs and context. Cultural, psychological and social factors all
          play a role in the treatment plan and in the way we give advice.
        </p>

        <p data-ani>
          Phrona is committed to guiding our clients on their journey towards a healthier life.

          adjust our approach to offer solutions that are sustainable and realistic. Whether the
          focus is weight management, nutritional advice for medical conditions or promoting
          overall well-being, we are here to support you.
        </p>
